 Debug and Test with Dev Tools and VS Code  
  
 1. Open DevTools in Chrome  
Open your HTML file in Chrome (right-click → Inspect, or press Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I).  
  
Click the Device Toolbar icon (top-left corner or press Ctrl+Shift+M) to toggle mobile simulation.  
  
 2. Simulate Responsive Screens  
Choose from presets (e.g., iPhone 12, Galaxy Fold) or manually set a width below 768px.  
  
Observe layout behavior, font scaling, and image responsiveness.  
  
 3. Inspect Styles and Test Live Changes  
Click the Elements tab in DevTools.  
Hover over elements to highlight them in the layout.  
Click an element (e.g., .event-card) and go to the Styles panel.  
Here, you can:  
Add/modify CSS live (e.g., change flex-direction, font sizes).  
Toggle rules on/off to test their effect.  
See which media query is active at that screen size.  
4. Check If External CSS is Loaded  
Go to the Network tab.  
Reload the page (F5 or right-click → reload).  
In the filter bar, type styles.css (or your stylesheet name).  
Make sure:  
The Status is 200 (OK).  
The Type is text/css.  
Click the file to view its contents and confirm it’s not empty or 404’d.
